# BrainTumour: A Brain Tumour Classification Project
### Data
This dataset consists of 3064 2D MRI scan slices of 3 kinds of brain tumours: glioma, pituitary tumor, meningioma.
### Method
I use a 4-layer deep ConvNet optimised with ADAM to achieve a 3-class classification accuracy of 0.9086 within 15 epochs. Despite the acccuracy, the model is underfitting and can be further optimised. This classification model is a precursor of my brain tumour segmentation project.
